# Character-Level Recurrent Neural Networks for Shakespearean Text Generation: A Comparative Study of LSTM and GRU Architectures

## Abstract

Character-level recurrent neural networks (CharRNNs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling sequential data, particularly for text generation tasks. In this project, we investigate the effectiveness of two popular recurrent architectures—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)—on the task of generating Shakespearean-style text. Using the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, we conduct a comprehensive set of experiments, including hyperparameter tuning and temperature-based sampling, to evaluate the generative quality and expressiveness of each model. Our results provide insights into the trade-offs between model complexity, creativity, and coherence, and offer practical recommendations for future work in character-level language modeling.

## Introduction

Text generation is a fundamental problem in natural language processing (NLP), with applications ranging from creative writing to code synthesis and dialogue systems. Character-level models, which operate at the granularity of individual characters rather than words, offer unique advantages: they are robust to out-of-vocabulary issues and can model fine-grained linguistic phenomena such as spelling, punctuation, and stylistic quirks. However, they also pose significant challenges, including longer sequence dependencies and increased data sparsity.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have long been the backbone of sequence modeling. Among RNN variants, LSTM and GRU architectures are widely used due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. In this project, we systematically compare LSTM and GRU models for the task of generating Shakespearean text, exploring how architectural choices and hyperparameters affect the quality and diversity of generated sequences.

## Related Work

Character-level RNNs were popularized by works such as Andrej Karpathy's "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks" (2015), which demonstrated their ability to generate realistic text in a variety of domains. Subsequent research has explored improvements in architecture, regularization, and sampling strategies. While LSTM and GRU have been compared in various NLP tasks, their comparative performance in creative text generation remains an open question, especially under different sampling temperatures and hyperparameter regimes.

## Methods

### Dataset

We use the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, a standard benchmark for character-level language modeling. The dataset consists of approximately 1 million characters of Shakespearean plays, encompassing a rich variety of characters, dialogue, and stage directions. The dataset's size and diversity make it both challenging and suitable for evaluating generative models.

### Model Architectures

We implement two recurrent architectures:
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Capable of learning long-range dependencies via gated memory cells.
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):** A simpler alternative to LSTM, with fewer parameters and comparable performance in many tasks.

Both models are implemented in PyTorch, with an embedding layer, one or more recurrent layers, and a linear output layer projecting to the character vocabulary.

### Training Procedure

- **Input Representation:** Each character is mapped to an integer index and embedded into a continuous vector space.
- **Sequence Length:** 100 characters per training sequence.
- **Batch Size:** 32 (varied in hyperparameter experiments).
- **Hidden Units:** 128.
- **Number of Layers:** 2 (varied in some experiments).
- **Optimizer:** Adam.
- **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss over the character vocabulary.
- **Hardware:** Training was performed on both CPU and GPU devices, with model checkpoints saved for reproducibility.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

We conducted experiments varying:
- **Model architecture:** LSTM vs. GRU
- **Number of layers:** 1 vs. 2
- **Learning rate:** 10, 30
- **Batch size:** 10, 40
- **Sampling temperature:** 0.5, 0.8, 1.2

### Text Generation

After training, we generated text samples from each model using different temperatures. The temperature parameter controls the randomness of sampling: lower values produce more conservative, repetitive text; higher values yield more creative, diverse outputs.

## Experiments

### LSTM vs. GRU: Quantitative and Qualitative Comparison

We trained both LSTM and GRU models with 2 layers and 128 hidden units. For each, we generated 500-character samples at temperatures 0.5, 0.8, and 1.2. The following table summarizes key statistics:

| Model | Temp | Text Length | Unique Chars | Avg Word Length |
|-------|------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| LSTM  | 0.5  | 599         | 67           | 4.51            |
| LSTM  | 0.8  | 599         | 67           | 5.07            |
| LSTM  | 1.2  | 599         | 67           | 5.40            |
| GRU   | 0.5  | 599         | 67           | 4.17            |
| GRU   | 0.8  | 599         | 67           | 4.78            |
| GRU   | 1.2  | 599         | 67           | 6.17            |

### Hyperparameter Tuning

We experimented with different learning rates (10, 30) and batch sizes (10, 40). Lower learning rates led to more stable training, while higher rates sometimes caused divergence. Larger batch sizes improved training speed but did not always yield better text quality. The number of layers (1 vs. 2) was also tested, with deeper models generally producing more coherent text but at the cost of longer training times.

### Temperature Effects

Temperature had a pronounced effect on the generated text:
- **Low temperature (0.5):** Output is repetitive and safe, with fewer creative word forms.
- **Medium temperature (0.8):** Balanced creativity and coherence, producing plausible Shakespearean dialogue.
- **High temperature (1.2):** Highly creative, sometimes nonsensical output, with more invented words and unusual phrasing.

### Training and Generation Efficiency

- **LSTM and GRU** both converged to similar loss values, but GRU trained slightly faster due to its simpler structure.
- Generation time was similar for both models on CPU.

## Results and Discussion

Our experiments reveal that both LSTM and GRU architectures are capable of generating stylistically plausible Shakespearean text at the character level. The choice of temperature is critical: lower values yield safer, more predictable text, while higher values encourage creativity at the expense of coherence. LSTM models tend to produce slightly longer words at moderate temperatures, while GRU models generate longer words at high temperatures, reflecting their different gating mechanisms.

Hyperparameter tuning confirmed that model depth and learning rate significantly affect output quality. Two-layer models outperformed single-layer models in coherence, but required more training time. Learning rates above 10 often led to unstable training, while batch size had a smaller effect on final text quality.

The Tiny Shakespeare dataset, while not large by modern standards, is sufficiently challenging for character-level modeling due to its diversity and length. Our results suggest that both LSTM and GRU are viable choices, with GRU offering a slight advantage in training speed and LSTM in output stability.

## Conclusion

This project provides a thorough investigation of character-level RNNs for text generation, comparing LSTM and GRU architectures on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset. Through systematic experimentation with model architecture, hyperparameters, and sampling temperature, we demonstrate the strengths and trade-offs of each approach. Our findings offer practical guidance for future work in creative text generation and sequence modeling.
